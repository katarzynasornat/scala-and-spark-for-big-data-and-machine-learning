# scala-and-spark-for-big-data-and-machine-learning
Here I put my notes and codes from the course Scala and Spark for Big Data and Machine Learning on Udemy


## Setup
Below I summarized all the points to cover the local setup on Windows for Hadoop 2.7 and Spark 2.0 + Scala (should also work for newer versions) which was required.

## Downloading JDK

Download the latest Java Development Kit that matches your system (32-bit vs 64-bit). You can find the download website from Oracle here or just Googling "Java Development Kit".

## Downloading Hadoop & Spark

Go to apache.spark.org and download a pre-built version of Spark (pre-built for Hadoop 2.7 and Later) and preferably Spark 2.0 or later
